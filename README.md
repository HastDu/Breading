# Breading, a file reading library because i hate using fs.
### Breading is a file format and a NodeJS library made for the sole purpouse of allowing you to read txt and bread files and making them global variables.
### .bread will come out eventually, but not any time soon as i am busy with school.
##### This is Open-Source and anyone willing to add/help can. Support is appreciated and you will be put on the wall of Bakers.
